            " My startup is about powering EV vehicles in a cost effective
            manner. When I first got this idea, I was clueless on what to do or
            how to proceed, luckily at the right moment, ciie conducted bootcamp
            cohort-1 and guided me all way long and now I have my own product
            with initial funding in hand and gained a lot of confidence to
            proceed forward. Thank you ciie for believing in me and hope to
            succeed in my startup".

            small lands to implement scientific farming. At first we only had an
            idea. Through cohort -1 , Ciie helped us getting a mentor and she
            played a major role throughout the bootcamp. They introduced to us
            the Stratup culture and how it's done from idea to product. I am
            glad that I attended the workshop and be able to continue with our
            startup. Thank you CIIE"
